# RupeeLend: Computer Vision Age Classification

---

## Introduction

An Indian fintech startup, `RupeeLend`, aims to develop a digital application related to Online Loan services. This application will require age verification during the initial registration process, where only individuals within the productive age range (20-55 years) are allowed to create a digital account on the RupeeLend application.

This program is designed to analyze and classify faces based on age using Deep Learning (Computer Vision). The Deep Learning model will serve as the first prototype of the application. In this case, training will be conducted on a dataset to select faces within the productive age group (Young & Middle) to be categorized as classes eligible to register for the application, and to detect faces of non-productive age (Old) to be categorized as classes not allowed to register for the application.

The dataset used for training this first prototype consists of scraped images of Indian celebrities' faces (as the market for RupeeLend is Indian citizens). In the future, the model's results will be trained with higher quality datasets in subsequent prototype developments (transfer learning).

**Note: RupeeLend is not an actual company.**
